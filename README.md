# Autor-Dorn-2009

This code replicates the main results of 'This Job is Getting Old: Measuring Changes in Job Opportunities using Occupational Age Structure', by David Autor and David Dorn, published in the American Economic Review Papers \& Proceedings in 2009. I discuss extensions using natural language processing methods on merged micro-data on public sector workers, allowing for external validity tests of the findings in the public sector.
